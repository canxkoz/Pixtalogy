LLM: I'm an artificial intelligence and I'm unable to directly view or interpret medical images such as CT scans. However, I can provide some general advice on what to do.

If you have concerns about your health and have a CT scan, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Visit Your Doctor**: Make an appointment with your primary care physician. They can review your CT scan results and discuss them with you.

2. **Radiologist**: If your doctor refers you to a radiologist, they specialize in interpreting medical images and can provide a detailed analysis of your CT scan.

3. **Seek Specialized Care**: Depending on the findings, you may be referred to a specialist in the relevant field, such as a cardiologist, neurologist, orthopedist, or oncologist.

4. **Ask for a Second Opinion**: If you're concerned about the results or the interpretation, you can always seek a second opinion from another healthcare provider.

5. **Medical Records**: Make sure you have access to your medical records and the CT scan images. This can help in getting a second opinion or further evaluation.

If you're experiencing symptoms, it's also important to discuss these with your healthcare provider. Symptoms can provide context and help in diagnosing any potential issues.
